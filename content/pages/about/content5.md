Is your digital initiative suffering from lack of data governance, or fragmented, entangled, outdated or Excel-based IT landscape? Do you feel like you need a KYB ("Know Your Business") initiative before you can proceed? No worries! You can get all the benefits of our solution, with no compromise on speed or quality. In addition, our professionals will help you analyse your processes (and store the results in a self-maintaining, digitally accessible way), establish sustainable governance and, if necessary, accelerate your Enterprise Data Governance initiatives. Our method works with any MDM software of your choice, and does not compete with your traditional approaches or tooling. There is no minimal maturity level, and no pre-requisites for your Agile Data Foundation.
