Every process has its own perspective on the real-world things it works with. Some will see the complex financial aspects and capture the granularity required to perform statutory reporting of transactions; the others will be concerned with the manufacturing and recipe details; others yet will be satisfied with a high-level logistical perspective. Which one is right? The answer is: they all are. From their own perspective. Instead of forcing them to accept on "global" truth, we shall allow each of them to operate within their own viewpoint, using their own set of terms and values. And since they are all talking about the same things, these viewpoints will be connected to each other to form a multi-dimensional reflection of reality relevant to the business.

If every process sees the world differently, so do the IT systems that support these processes. To operate the information coming from multiple systems, we should not try and invent a new "language" all these systems should be translated into. Instead, we should do what human interpreters do: understand the way every system refers to real-world things touched by the processes they support, and translate it into the language of the other systems.
