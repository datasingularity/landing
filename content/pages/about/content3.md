Your users are used to their own terminology and have their own contextual view on the world. Our Agile Data Foundation allows your digital products to speak the language of your users, no matter who they are and how different their viewpoints are. By capturing and exposing data in context, we enable you to cater right data in the right shape for every user, while never loosing the unified perspective.
